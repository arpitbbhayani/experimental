# Experimental

Bunch of prorotypes and experiments to build a deeper understanding of the
concepts and tools.

Each folder is a separate project and contains its own README.md with more
information on how to build and run it.

> Note: This is not a production codebase. It's just a bunch of experiments and
> prototypes.
